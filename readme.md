## Speech Recognition Tool

### What is this repository for? ###
* As always it it was just for fun and to learn new things. This is the implementation of a great interface from Web APIs (actualy from WEB Speech API) - the Speach Recognition Interface. More here: [MDN Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API)

* The app itself recognizes spoken text, prints it on the screen and triggers some simple actions on the event of recognizing certain words. 

### How do I get set up? ###
* Generally, the working wersion is available here **(ONLY CHROME !!!)**:
    * https://mitroc.github.io/speech-recognition/

* When cloned, you need to serve your code through a web server for recognition to work. Localhost will do. If you don't have one, follow these steps:
    * `npm install` - this will install the [Browser Sync](https://browsersync.io) server
    * `npm start` - this will start the service on localhost (browser should open automatically)
* Support for different browsers is very limitted. It should work on FF, but I could not get it to work.
